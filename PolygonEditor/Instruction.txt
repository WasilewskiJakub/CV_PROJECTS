Polygon Editor
-------------------------------------
Program has 2 operating modes:
Create:
	allows the user to create a polygon vertex by clicking the left mouse button.
	In create mode it is not possible to create 2 vertices overlapping each other, the only possibility
	is to click on the first vertex of the current polygon to close it.
	In Create mode it is not possible to switch between Bresenham and System Line modes.
	During creation, you can change the color of the next vertex with Choose Color.
Edit:
	When switching to Edit mode, the current polygon will be automatically closed, unless it has been closed earlier,
	selecting edges and vertices is done by clicking on them with the left mouse button.
	Depending on the selected object, we have different functions:
	Vertex:
		- Remove - removes a vertex and adjacent edges with their relations.
		- Color - changes the vertex to the color of the currently selected color.
	Edge:
		- Remove - removes an edge with adjacent vertices.
		- Split - creates a vertex in the middle of an edge, deleting relations from it.
		- Length - keeps the current edge length permanently.
		- Perpendicular - (select edge-> Perpendicular-> select edge-> Perpendicular) after that
		the edges will become perpendicular to each other after the procedure.
	Polygon:
		- Select Polygon - when the flag is selected click on any vertex or edge of the polygon
		will mark it.
		- Remove - remove the selected polygon.	
Moving an Object (Edge, Vertex, Polygon)
	- Object moving is available when you are in edit mode and the object is selected. We move through
	Press and hold the mouse scroll while moving the mouse.

Relations:
	- The limit of the length relation per polygon is n-1, where n - the number of edges.
	- Perpendicular - perpendicularity consists in determining the straight line pattern describing the first edge, and
	finding the pattern of a line perpendicular to it passing through one of the points from the edge no.2.
